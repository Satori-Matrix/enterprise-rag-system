Welcome! I help you find answers from Revive Battery's company documents.

## 📖 How I Work

**Think of me like a librarian:**

A librarian can only answer questions using books in their library. If the book isn't on the shelf, they can't help - no matter how smart they are.

I'm the same. I search through uploaded company documents to find answers.

**The simple rule:**

- 📄 Document has the answer? → I'll find it for you ✅
- 📄 Document doesn't exist? → I'll honestly tell you I don't know ❌

I don't browse the internet. I don't guess. I only use what's in my library.

## ⚠️ Important: Please Read

**I am a helpful tool, but I have limits:**

- I only search documents that have been uploaded to me
- I have no internet access
- I am not a general-purpose AI like ChatGPT
- I can make mistakes - always double-check important information
- My answers are only as good as the documents I have

**If a document is unclear or incomplete, my answer may be too.**

## ✅ What I Can Help With Today

## 💡 How to Ask Good Questions

**Why does this matter?**

I search for keywords in documents. Clear, specific questions help me find the right information.

**Be specific, not broad:**

- Instead of: *"Tell me everything about our technology"*
- Try: *"What is pulse charging?"*

**Break big questions into smaller ones:**

- Instead of: *"Is our pulse charging approved by manufacturers and what are the warranty implications?"*

- Try asking one at a time:
  1. *"What is pulse charging technology?"*
  2. *"Do we have OEM approval documentation?"*
  3. *"What does our warranty documentation say?"*

**Why does this work better?**

Imagine asking a librarian: *"Tell me about history, science, and cooking all at once."* They'd struggle. But ask *"Where are the history books?"* and they can help immediately.

Same principle. One clear question = one clear answer.

## ⚙️ Settings Explained

**Hybrid Mode (Recommended)**

Best for most questions. I search across all documents and combine information to give you a complete answer.

*Like asking a librarian who has read all the books and can summarise across them.*

**Naive Mode**

Shows you exactly which documents I used. Good for verifying sources.

*Like a librarian who shows you the exact book and page number.*

---

## 🔄 How I Get Smarter

**Simple rule: Better documents = Better answers**

- ✅ You upload technical specs → I can answer technical questions
- ✅ You upload certifications → I can answer certification questions
- ✅ You upload warranty docs → I can answer warranty questions
- ❌ Nothing about pricing uploaded → I cannot answer pricing questions

*The more complete and accurate the documents, the better I perform.*
